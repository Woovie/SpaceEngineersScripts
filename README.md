# Space Engineers Scripts
This is a small repository of scripts I've written for Space Engineers programming blocks
- se-rgb.cs
  - This is a script for doing RGB color patterns with lights on a ship.
  - You need to make two lines in the Custom Data of the programming block this code is used in. Line 1 is your groups, line 2 is your speed.
    - Line 1 example: ;lights1;lights2;lights3
    - Line 2 example: 1
  - Line 1 is a value separated field. First character defines your separation variable.
  - Line 2 is a value between 0 and 255 representing speed.
